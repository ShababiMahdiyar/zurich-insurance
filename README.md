Zurich Project
Introduction
Hello and welcome to my project submission for the Zurich Customer Portal. This project is a culmination of my skills and practices in front-end development, crafted with attention to detail and a focus on modern web development standards. 

Project Overview
The Zurich Portal is a web application designed with Next.js, integrating Google OAuth2 for authentication, Redux for state management, and server-side rendering for enhanced performance and security.

Key Features
Google OAuth2 Authentication: I implemented a secure login flow using Google OAuth2, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience.
Redux State Management: The application's state is managed using Redux, showcasing my ability to handle application state in a scalable and efficient manner.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): I utilized Next.js's SSR capabilities to improve the initial load time and search engine discoverability of the application.
Security: Emphasizing application security, I ensured that all sensitive business logic is executed server-side, protecting the application from potential security threats.
Dynamic Data Filtering: The users list feature filters data dynamically, demonstrating my skill in handling API requests and manipulating data efficiently.
Unit Testing: The application includes a suite of unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library, highlighting my commitment to maintaining code quality and reliability.
